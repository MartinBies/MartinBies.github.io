## Software
You can find the latest updates on my software at my [github-page](https://github.com/herearound). Among others, I am author and maintainer of the [*ToricVarieties_project*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project), which includes (but is not limited to) the following packages:

* [*ToricVarieties*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/ToricVarieties)
* [*AdditionsForToricVarieties*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/AdditionsForToricVarieties)
* [*ToolsForFPGradedModules*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/ToolsForFPGradedModules)
* [*TruncationsOfFPGradedModules*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/TruncationsOfFPGradedModules)
* [*SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties)
* [*cohomCalgInterface*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/cohomCalgInterface)
* [*SpasmInterface*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/SpasmInterface)
* [*H0Approximator*](https://github.com/homalg-project/ToricVarieties_project/tree/master/H0Approximator)

Other packages to which I contributed include:

* [*TopcomInterface*](https://github.com/homalg_project/TopcomInterface)
* [*FreydCategoriesForCAP*](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/tree/master/FreydCategoriesForCAP)

For historic reasons, let me also list the first implementation of f.p. graded modules as FreydCategories. By now these packages are deprecated and their functionality is provided by the above packages *FreydCategoriesForCAP*:

* [*CAPCategoryOfProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/CAPCategoryOfProjectiveGradedModules)
* [*CAPPresentationCategory*](https://github.com/HereAround/CAPPresentationCategory)
* [*PresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/PresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules)
* [*TruncationsOfPresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/TruncationsOfPresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules)
