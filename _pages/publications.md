## Software
You can find the latest updates on my software at my [github-page](https://github.com/herearound). I am author and maintainer of the following *CAP*- and *gap*-packages:

* [*CAPCategoryOfProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/CAPCategoryOfProjectiveGradedModules)
* [*CAPPresentationCategory*](https://github.com/HereAround/CAPPresentationCategory)
* [*PresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/PresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules)
* [*TruncationsOfPresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules*](https://github.com/HereAround/TruncationsOfPresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules)
* [*FreydCategoriesForCAP*](https://github.com/HereAround/CAP_project/tree/master/FreydCategoriesForCAP)
* [*ToricVarieties*](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project/tree/master/ToricVarieties)
* [*SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties*](https://github.com/HereAround/SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties)
* [*TopcomInterface*](https://github.com/HereAround/TopcomInterface)
* [*TriangulationsAndBlowupsForToricVarieties*](https://github.com/HereAround/TriangulationsAndBlowupsForToricVarieties)

I am currently developing the

* [*cohomCalgInterface*](https://github.com/HereAround/cohomCalgInterface)

and intend to extend it, so that the *Koszul-extension* of [*cohomCalg*](https://benjaminjurke.com/academia-and-research/cohomcalg) becomes directly available to gap.
