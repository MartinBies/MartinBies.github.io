By upbringing, I am a theoretical high energy physicist with a focus on string theory. In the past years, I have been working on a framework of string theory, called F-theory. It strongly utilizes geometric tools to investigate solutions to string theory. Roughly speaking, I am interested in translating physics questions (ideally inspired by string or F-theory) into a mathematical question (ideally within the framework of geometry), which in turn can be solved with the help of enumerative computer techniques. Details are available in my [Research statement](/ResearchStatement.pdf).
