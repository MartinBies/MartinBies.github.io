## Overview

I work on open-source software on [github](https://github.com/herearound), where I have added about 500.000 lines of codes and modified about another 500.000 lines of code. My coding experience includes julia, C++, python and many more. Currently, I focus on the [OSCAR Computer Algebra System](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl), written in the modern programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
