I am so glad, that my homepage is running now!

The layout for this website has been taken from [@MohamedBarakat](https://github.com/mohamed-barakat). Thanks a lot for having this available as public repository.

Also, I would like to thank [@Miriam-Gerharz](https://github.com/Miriam-Gerharz) for adapting this layout to my needs!
