# Welcome to My Homepage

Versatile Postdoctoral Researcher with a [PhD in Physics from Heidelberg University](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/24045/). My research spans high energy physics, mathematics, and open-source software development, emphasizing my commitment to interdisciplinary research.

With full English proficiency and strong public speaking skills, I have a strong track record of international collaborations. [My publications](https://martinbies.github.io/publications/) cover diverse mathematical topics including toric geometry, Freyd categories, Brill-Noether theory, and root bundles.

Skilled in Julia, Python, and C++, I develop software on [GitHub](https://github.com/herearound) for computational research.


## Research

I work on F-theory, a string theory framework using geometry to study its solutions. My focus is translating physics questions into mathematical challenges, then solving those challenges with enumerative computer techniques. More details are in my [Research Statement](/ResearchStatement.pdf) and [CV](https://martinbies.github.io/CV_MartinBies.pdf).


## Publications

For a full list of my publications, see [inspire](https://inspirehep.net/author/profile/M.Bies.1), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Martin+Bies&searchtype=author&abstracts=hide&order=-announced_date_first&size=50), [orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9609-1693), [scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57197835420) or the summary [here](https://martinbies.github.io/publications/).


## Software

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/herearound) showcases my work on open-source software, with contributions to around 500,000 lines of code. I specialize in Julia, Python, C++. Currently, I focus on the [OSCAR Computer Algebra System](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl), with emphasis on [*Toric Varieties*](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/AlgebraicGeometry/ToricVarieties/intro/) and [*FTheoryTools*](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/Experimental/FTheoryTools/introduction/).


## Talks and Conferences

I have presented my research at numerous conferences. For details, see [here](https://martinbies.github.io/conferences%20and%20talks/).


## Teaching

I enjoy sharing knowledge with students: [Teaching Philosophy](https://martinbies.github.io/TeachingStatementMartinBies.pdf), [Teaching Record](https://martinbies.github.io/teaching/).
