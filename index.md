## Research

By upbringing, I am a theoretical high energy physicist with a focus on string theory. In the past years, I have been working on a framework of string theory, called F-theory. It strongly utilizes geometric tools to investigate solutions to string theory. Roughly speaking, I am interested in translating physics questions (ideally inspired by string or F-theory) into a mathematical question (ideally within the framework of geometry), which in turn can be solved with the help of enumerative computer techniques. Details are available in my [Research statement](/ResearchStatement.pdf).

## Software

I work on open-source software on [github](https://github.com/herearound), where I have added about 500.000 lines of codes and modified about another 500.000 lines of code. My coding experience includes julia, C++, python and many more. Currently, I focus on the [OSCAR Computer Algebra System](https://github.com/oscar-system/Oscar.jl), written in the modern programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
