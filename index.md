Versatile Postdoctoral Researche with [Doctor in Physics](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/24045/) from Heidelberg University.

My research spans physics, mathematics, and software development, emphasizing my interdisciplinary commitment. This research has led to [Publications](https://martinbies.github.io/publications/) on diverse mathematical topics, including toric geometry, Freyd categories, Brill-Noether theory, and root bundles.

With full English proficiency and strong public speaking skills, I have a strong track record of international collaborations, [Event Participation](https://martinbies.github.io/events/) and [Teaching](https://martinbies.github.io/teaching/).

Skilled in Julia, Python, and C++, I develop software on [GitHub](https://github.com/herearound) for computational research.


## Research

I work on F-theory, a string theory framework using geometry to study its solutions. My focus is translating physics questions into mathematical challenges, then solving those challenges with enumerative computer techniques. More details are in my [Research Statement](/Materials/General/ResearchStatement.pdf) and [CV](/Materials/General/CV_MartinBies.pdf).


## Publications

For a full list of my publications, see [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/author/profile/M.Bies.1), [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Martin+Bies&searchtype=author&abstracts=hide&order=-announced_date_first&size=50), [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9609-1693), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57197835420) or [This Summary](https://martinbies.github.io/publications/).


## Software

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/herearound) showcases my work on open-source software, with contributions to around 500,000 lines of code. I specialize in Julia, Python, C++. Currently, I focus on the [OSCAR Computer Algebra System](https://www.oscar-system.org/), with emphasis on [*Toric Varieties*](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/AlgebraicGeometry/ToricVarieties/intro/) and [*FTheoryTools*](https://docs.oscar-system.org/stable/Experimental/FTheoryTools/introduction/).


## Events

I have participated in numerous conferences and workshops, delivered talks, and presented posters. For details, see [here](https://martinbies.github.io/events/).


## Teaching

I enjoy sharing knowledge with students: [Teaching Philosophy](/Materials/General/TeachingStatementMartinBies.pdf), [Teaching Record](https://martinbies.github.io/teaching/).
